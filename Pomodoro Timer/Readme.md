# Pomodoro Timer

A simple and easy to use Pomodoro Timer application implemented in Python using the tkinter library for the GUI, PIL library to add a background image, and playsound library to play a sound when the timer completes.


## How it works
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The application has two buttons, "Start" and "Break". The "Start" button starts a countdown timer for 25 minutes, and when the timer completes, it plays a sound and displays a message to take a break. The "Break" button starts a countdown timer for 5 minutes, and when the timer completes, it plays a sound and displays a message to get back to work.


## Features
- Simple and clean user interface
- Two countdown timers, one for work and one for break
- Sound notification when the timer completes
- Background image to add a little bit of fun to the application


## How to use
1. Download the script and run it using the command `python pomodoro.py` in the terminal.
2. Click the "Start" button to start the 25-minute countdown timer for work.
3. Once the timer completes, a sound will play and a message will appear to take a break.
4. Click the "Break" button to start the 5-minute countdown timer for break.
5. Once the timer completes, a sound will play and a message will appear to get back to work.

## Dependencies
This app depends on the following libraries:
- tkinter
- PIL
- playsound

Make sure that you have these libraries installed before running the script.
