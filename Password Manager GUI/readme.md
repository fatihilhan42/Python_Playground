As you can see here on the left side of the screen, it is designed to generate passwords (sorry for the bad design :))) It is set so that after entering the length of the passwords you can also choose their complexity. Then there is a keyword and website section where you specify for which application or website you want to save the password.



### Search password: 

This section contains the password search screen. The saved passwords will appear in the table and a special qr code for a password will be generated on the screen for easy copying on your phone. By scanning the qr code on your phone, you can easily see the password on your phone.

It is also worth noting that if you click on the password twice on this screen, the password will be removed from the database.
